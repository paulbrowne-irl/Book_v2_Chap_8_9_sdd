Update the interface to use a GUI instead of a CLI. The GUI should be used to input the patient information, and the output should be displayed in the GUI. 

The GUI should be implemented in Java Swing.

The GUI should have the following features:
* Input fields for patient information with dropdowns where appropriate to guide the selection of symptoms as specified in the triage.drl file
* A button to submit the patient information
* A display area for the output
* A button to save the output to a file
* A button to exit the application
